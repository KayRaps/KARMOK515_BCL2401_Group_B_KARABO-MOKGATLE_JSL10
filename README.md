## Escape Vanilla JS Challenge
* This project, is an interactive challenge that is built with vanilla JavaScript.
* It consists of three different "rooms" that I needed to solve using vanilla JavaScript.

## Table of Contents

* Getting Started
* Rooms
- Room 1: The JSON Library
- Room 2: The Set Chamber
- Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth

* Resources
- index.html
- styles.css

- directions.json
- books.json
- manuscript.js

## Rooms

* Room 1: The JSON Library
- In this room, you are given a JSON object representing a library with several books. Your task is to find the most recent book.

* Room 2: The Set Chamber
- In this room, you are given two arrays of words. Your task is to find the common concepts (words that appear in both arrays).

* Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth
- In this room, you are presented with a maze represented as a 2D array. Your task is to find the exit by navigating through the maze asynchronously.

## Reflections

- In this project, there wasn't a lot of coding as the previous ones. 
- I could see even the smallest thing, can change the whole code.
- I truly saw the await function in action, on the console, how it caused a delay.
- Overrall, with time, i will definetly get better.
- I will definitely be able to solve more complex problems.
